# x3dom-1.5.0-dev

copy of an older version of x3dom that supports elevationGrid

Newer versions of X3DOM do not appear to support the elevationGrid node.

We just needed to keep this somewhere on the web.  We could not find it
elsewhere.  See https://www.x3dom.org/ for details.  By looking at the
latest releases of x3dom it would appear that development has stopped; as
of Wednesday, Jun 13 2018 the last stable release is 1.7.2, dated December
19, 2016.  So yes, development has stopped.  Time to move on to three.js
or just use WebGL; given that development of x3dom has stopped at a broken
version.
